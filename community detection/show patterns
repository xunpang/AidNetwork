##q: 1/2/3/4, threshold of aid amount to select the number above which the aids are counted
##j: 2 to 10, the number of communities
##m: a character indicating the name of the baseline country
##t: 1 or 0, if 1, only show the donors, if 0, only show the recipients
##x: a number between 0 and 1, if the community component is below x, then the componet will be set to 1
##example:
##showpattern(3, 4, " China ",0, 0)
##means choose the third threshold, i.e., 20000000 to select the counted aids, the number of communities is 4, we will only show the community that donor China mostly belong to
