STRUCTURAL VARIABLES
ctrdegree: centralization based on degree	
ctrclose: centralization based on closeness
ctreigen: centralization based on eigenvector

Centralization is a general method for calculating a graph-level centrality score based on node-level centrality measure. 
The formula for this is
C(G)=sum( max(c(w), w) - c(v),v),
where c(v) is the centrality of vertex v.


NODE-LEVEL VARIABLES
degree: centrality_degree
closenessvalue: centrality_closeness
eigen: centrality_eigenvector
hubs: The hub scores of the vertices are defined as the principal eigenvector of A*t(A), where A is the adjacency matrix of the graph.
authority: The authority scores of the vertices are defined as the principal eigenvector of t(A)*A, where A is the adjacency matrix of the graph.
